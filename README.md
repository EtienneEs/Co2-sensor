# Introduction

__Question:__  
Do we really need to sleep with an open Window for better air quality ??
Is it not enough to open the window shortly to let some fresh air in and close it
 afterwards before going to bed ?

__Background:__  
Sleep quality is a highly researched topic and it has been shown that multiple factors
influence sleep quality such as drugs (Caffeine, Alcohol and Nicotine), noise and light.<sup>[1]</sup>
Another external factor which affects sleep quality is air quality. It has been shown that
the most potent respiratory stimuli is Carbon dioxid.<sup>[2,3,__4__]</sup>  

__Aim:__
In order to analyse air quality in various conditions (closed doors, closed windows ...) 
a Rasberry Pi 2 is combined with a CO<sub>2</sub>-Sensor (the Senseair S8 )
 and a Temperature/Humidity/Pressure sensor (the Bme280).

This Project is a collaboration with Reto Läderach.
